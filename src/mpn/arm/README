This directory contains mpn functions for ARM processors.
It has been optimized for StrongARM.

TODO

Write mpn_addmul_2.  The speed of mpn_addmul_1 is 9.75 c/l;
mpn_addmul_2 could run at 8 c/l.  mpn_addmul_N could
approach 6 c/l, but register shortage will make this hard.

Perhaps nails is the way to go even for an embedded processor like
this, since the umlal accumulation could be used very effectively in
that case.  with just 2 nail bits, we should get close to 5 c/l for a
mpn_addmul_N or mpn_mul_basecase.
