dnl  Forcibly disable profiling.
dnl
dnl  The entrypoints and inits are small enough not to worry about, the real
dnl  routines arrived at will have any profiling.  Also, the way the code
dnl  here ends with a jump means we won't work properly with the
dnl  "instrument" profiling scheme anyway.

dnl  Usage: FAT_ENTRY(name, offset)
dnl
dnl  Emit a fat binary entrypoint function of the given name.  This is the
dnl  normal entry for applications, eg. __gmpn_add_n.
dnl
dnl  The code simply jumps through the function pointer in __gmpn_cpuvec at
dnl  the given "offset" (in bytes).
dnl
dnl  For non-PIC, the jumps are 5 bytes each, aligning them to 8 should be
dnl  fine for all x86s.
dnl
dnl  For PIC, the jumps are 20 bytes each, and are best aligned to 16 to
dnl  ensure at least the first two instructions don't cross a cache line
dnl  boundary.
dnl
dnl  Note the extra `' ahead of PROLOGUE obscures it from the HAVE_NATIVE
dnl  grepping in configure, stopping that code trying to eval something with
dnl  $1 in it.

dnl  Usage: FAT_INIT(name, offset)
dnl
dnl  Emit a fat binary initializer function of the given name.  These
dnl  functions are the initial values for the pointers in __gmpn_cpuvec.
dnl
dnl  The code simply calls __gmpn_cpuvec_init, and then jumps back through
dnl  the __gmpn_cpuvec pointer, at the given "offset" (in bytes).
dnl  __gmpn_cpuvec_init will have stored the address of the selected
dnl  implementation there.
dnl
dnl  Only one of these routines will be executed, and only once, since after
dnl  that all the __gmpn_cpuvec pointers go to real routines.  So there's no
dnl  need for anything special here, just something small and simple.  To
dnl  keep code size down, "fat_init" is a shared bit of code, arrived at
dnl  with the offset in %al.  %al is used since the movb instruction is 2
dnl  bytes where %eax would be 4.
dnl
dnl  Note having `PROLOGUE in FAT_INIT obscures that PROLOGUE from the
dnl  HAVE_NATIVE grepping in configure, preventing that code trying to eval
dnl  something with $1 in it.
dnl
dnl  We need to preserve parameter registers over the __gmpn_cpuvec_init call
