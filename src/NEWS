Changes between GMP version 5.0.0 and 5.0.1

  BUGS FIXED
  * Fat builds fixed.

  * Fixed crash for huge multiplies when old FFT_TABLE2 type of parameter
    selection tables' sentinel was smaller than multiplied operands.

  * The solib numbers now reflect the removal of the documented but preliminary
    mpn_bdivmod function; we correctly flag incompatibility with GMP 4.3.
    GMP 5.0.0 has this wrong, and should perhaps be uninstalled to avoid
    confusion.

  SPEEDUPS
  * Multiplicaton of large numbers has indirectly been sped up through
    better FFT tuning and processor recognition.  Since many operations
    depend on multiplication, there will be a general speedup.

  FEATURES
  * More Core i3, i5 an Core i7 processor models are recognised.

  * Fixes and workarounds for Mac OS quirks should make this GMP version
    build using many of the different versions of "Xcode".

  MISC
  * The amount of scratch memory needed for multiplication of huge numbers
    have been reduced substantially (but is still larger than in GMP 4.3.)

  * Likewise, the amount of scratch memory needed for division of large
    numbers have been reduced substantially.

  * The FFT tuning code of tune/tuneup.c has been completely rewritten,
    and new, large FFT parameter selection tables are provided for many
    machines.

  * Upgraded to the latest autoconf, automake, libtool.


Changes between GMP version 4.3.X and 5.0.0

  BUGS FIXED
  * None (contains the same fixes as release 4.3.2).

  SPEEDUPS
  * Multiplication has been overhauled:
    (1) Multiplication of larger same size operands has been improved with
        the addition of two new Toom functions and a new internal function
        mpn_mulmod_bnm1 (computing U * V mod (B^n-1), B being the word base.
        This latter function is used for the largest products, waiting for a
        better Schoenhage-Strassen U * V mod (B^n+1) implementation.
    (2) Likewise for squaring.
    (3) Multiplication of different size operands has been improved with the
        addition of many new Toom function, and by selecting underlying
        functions better from the main multiply functions.

  * Division and mod have been overhauled:
    (1) Plain "schoolbook" division is reimplemented using faster quotient
        approximation.
    (2) Division Q = N/D, R = N mod D where both the quotient and remainder
        are needed now runs in time O(M(log(N))).  This is an improvement of
        a factor log(log(N))
    (3) Division where just the quotient is needed is now O(M(log(Q))) on
        average.
    (4) Modulo operations using Montgomery REDC form now take time O(M(n)).
    (5) Exact division Q = N/D by means of mpz_divexact has been improved
        for all sizes, and now runs in time O(M(log(N))).

  * The function mpz_powm is now faster for all sizes.  Its complexity has
    gone from O(M(n)log(n)m) to O(M(n)m) where n is the size of the modulo
    argument and m is the size of the exponent.  It is also radically
    faster for even modulus, since it now partially factors such modulus
    and performs two smaller modexp operations, then uses CRT.

  * The internal support for multiplication yielding just the lower n limbs
    has been improved by using Mulders' algorithm.

  * Computation of inverses, both plain 1/N and 1/N mod B^n have been
    improved by using well-tuned Newton iterations, and wrap-around
    multiplication using mpn_mulmod_bnm1.

  * A new algorithm makes mpz_perfect_power_p asymptotically faster.

  * The function mpz_remove uses a much faster algorithm, is better tuned,
    and also benefits from the division improvements.

  * Intel Atom and VIA Nano specific optimisations.

  * Plus hundreds of smaller improvements and tweaks!

  FEATURES
  * New mpz function: mpz_powm_sec for side-channel quiet modexp
    computations.

  * New mpn functions: mpn_sqr, mpn_and_n, mpn_ior_n, mpn_xor_n, mpn_nand_n,
    mpn_nior_n, mpn_xnor_n, mpn_andn_n, mpn_iorn_n, mpn_com, mpn_neg,
    mpn_copyi, mpn_copyd, mpn_zero.

  * The function mpn_tdiv_qr now allows certain argument overlap.

  * Support for fat binaries for 64-bit x86 processors has been added.

  * A new type, mp_bitcnt_t for bignum bit counts, has been introduced.

  * Support for Windows64 through mingw64 has been added.

  * The cofactors of mpz_gcdext and mpn_gcdext are now more strictly
    normalised, returning to how GMP 4.2 worked.  (Note that also release
    4.3.2 has this change.)

  MISC
  * The mpn_mul function should no longer be used for squaring,
    instead use the new mpn_sqr.

  * The algorithm selection has been improved, the number of thresholds have
    more than doubled, and the tuning and use of existing thresholds have
    been improved.

  * The tune/speed program can measure many of new functions.

  * The mpn_bdivmod function has been removed.  We do not consider this an
    incompatible change, since the function was marked as preliminary.

  * The testsuite has been enhanced in various ways.

    normalised, returning to how GMP 4.2 worked.


Changes between GMP version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1

  Bugs:
  * Fixed bug in mpn_gcdext, affecting also mpz_gcdext and mpz_invert.
    The bug could cause a cofactor to have a leading zero limb, which

  Speedups:
  * None.

  Features:
  * Workarounds for various issues with Mac OS X's build tools.

    powers that can be written both as an even and odd power.
  * We might accidentally have added bugs since there is a large amount of
    new code in this release.

  Speedups:
  * Vastly improved assembly code for x86-64 processors from AMD and Intel.
  * Major improvements also for many other processor families, such as
    Alpha, PowerPC, and Itanium.
  * New sub-quadratic mpn_gcd and mpn_gcdext, as well as improved basecase

    processors.
  * The experimental nails feature does not work in this release, but
    it might be re-enabled in the future.

  Misc:

  Features:
  * The allocation functions now detect overflow of the mpz_t type.  This means
    that overflow will now cause an abort, except when the allocation
    computation itself overflows.  (Such overflow can probably only happen in
    powering functions; we will detect powering overflow in the future.)


Changes between GMP version 4.2.1 and 4.2.2

  * License is now LGPL version 3.

  * gmp_scanf and friends now accept C99 hex floats.
  * Numeric input and output can now be in bases up to 62.
  * Comparisons mpz_cmp_d, mpz_cmpabs_d, mpf_cmp_d recognise infinities.
  * Conversions mpz_get_d, mpq_get_d, mpf_get_d truncate towards zero,
    previously their behaviour was unspecified.
  * Fixes for overflow issues with operands >= 2^31 bits.

  Caveats:
  * mpfr is gone, and will from now on be released only separately.  Please see

Changes between GMP version 2.0 and 2.0.2

* Many bug fixes.


Changes between GMP version 1.3.2 and 2.0

* Division routines in the mpz class have changed.  There are three classes of
  functions, that rounds the quotient to -infinity, 0, and +infinity,
  respectively.  The first class of functions have names that begin with
  mpz_fdiv (f is short for floor), the second class' names begin with mpz_tdiv
  (t is short for trunc), and the third class' names begin with mpz_cdiv (c is
  short for ceil).

  The old division routines beginning with mpz_m are similar to the new
  mpz_fdiv, with the exception that some of the new functions return useful
  values.

  The old function names can still be used.  All the old functions names will
  now do floor division, not trunc division as some of them used to.  This was
  changed to make the functions more compatible with common mathematical
  practice.

  The mpz_mod and mpz_mod_ui functions now compute the mathematical mod
  function.  I.e., the sign of the 2nd argument is ignored.

* The mpq assignment functions do not canonicalize their results.  A new
  function, mpq_canonicalize must be called by the user if the result is not
  known to be canonical.
* The mpn functions are now documented.  These functions are intended for
  very time critical applications, or applications that need full control over
  memory allocation.  Note that the mpn interface is irregular and hard to
  use.
* New functions for arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic.  Names
  begin with `mpf_'.  Associated type mpf_t.
* New and improved mpz functions, including much faster GCD, fast exact
  division (mpz_divexact), bit scan (mpz_scan0 and mpz_scan1), and number
  theoretical functions like Jacobi (mpz_jacobi) and multiplicative inverse
  (mpz_invert).
* New variable types (mpz_t and mpq_t) are available that makes syntax of
  mpz and mpq calls nicer (no need for & before variables).  The MP_INT and
  MP_RAT types are still available for compatibility.
* Uses GNU configure.  This makes it possible to choose target architecture
  and CPU variant, and to compile into a separate object directory.
* Carefully optimized assembly for important inner loops.  Support for DEC
  Alpha, Amd 29000, HPPA 1.0 and 1.1, Intel Pentium and generic x86, Intel
  i960, Motorola MC68000, MC68020, MC88100, and MC88110, Motorola/IBM
  PowerPC, National NS32000, IBM POWER, MIPS R3000, R4000, SPARCv7,
  SuperSPARC, generic SPARCv8, and DEC VAX.  Some support also for ARM,
  Clipper, IBM ROMP (RT), and Pyramid AP/XP.
* Faster.  Thanks to the assembler code, new algorithms, and general tuning.
  In particular, the speed on machines without GCC is improved.
* Support for machines without alloca.
* Now under the LGPL.

INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN GMP 1 AND GMP 2

* mpq assignment functions do not canonicalize their results.
* mpz division functions round differently.
* mpz mod functions now really compute mod.
* mpz_powm and mpz_powm_ui now really use mod for reduction.
